Successful Authentication:

Verify that the login API returns a valid authentication token for correct credentials.
Ensure the token is valid for a specified duration.


Invalid Credentials:

Test the API response when incorrect username or email is provided.
Test the API response when incorrect password is provided.

Token Security:

Validate that the API enforces proper token validation.
Ensure that expired tokens are rejected.
Test token refresh functionality if applicable.

Rate Limiting and Security:

Verify that the API has proper rate-limiting mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks.
Test for security measures against common vulnerabilities like Mongodb and cross-site scripting.

Error Handling:

Test the API's response for various error scenarios (e.g., server errors, malformed requests).
Ensure that error messages do not reveal sensitive information.
Multi-factor Authentication (if applicable):

If the app supports multi-factor authentication, test the API's handling of multi-factor authentication requests

Test Cases for Posting:

Create Post:

Verify that a user can successfully create a post with text.
Test creating a post with a combination of text and multimedia elements (images, videos, links).
Ensure that the post character limit is enforced.



Edit and Delete Post:

Validate the ability to edit the content of an existing post.
Verify that users can delete their own posts.
Ensure that deleted posts are removed from the user's profile and others' feeds.
